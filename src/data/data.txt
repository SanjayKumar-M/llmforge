History
2008–2010: Initial seasons
Main articles: Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2008, 2009, and 2010
In September 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced the establishment of the Indian Premier League (IPL), a Twenty20 competition set to begin in 2008.[7] On 24 January 2008, an auction was held in Mumbai for the league's teams, which represented eight different cities in India, including Bengaluru. The Bangalore franchise was acquired by Vijay Mallya for US$111.6 million, making it the second-highest bid, slightly less than Reliance Industries' US$111.9 million bid for the Mumbai Indians.[8]


Rahul Dravid was the team's icon player in 2008.
Ahead of the 2008 player auction, the IPL designated Rahul Dravid as the icon player for the Bangalore franchise. This designation ensured that Dravid would be paid 15% more than the highest bid player at the auction.[9] The franchise acquired several prominent Indian and international players, including Jacques Kallis, Anil Kumble, Zaheer Khan, Mark Boucher, Dale Steyn, and Cameron White.[10] In the second round of the auction, they also signed Ross Taylor, Misbah-ul-Haq, and India under-19 World Cup-winning captain Virat Kohli.[11] The franchise named Dravid as the captain of the team and appointed Venkatesh Prasad as the head coach.[12] The team struggled in the inaugural season, winning only four out of their 14 matches and finishing seventh in the eight-team table.[13] Dravid was the sole player to score more than 300 runs in the tournament, and the team even had to bench their most expensive foreign player, Kallis, for several matches due to his poor form.[14][15] Midway through the season, the string of failures led to the sacking of CEO Charu Sharma, who was replaced by Brijesh Patel. Mallya publicly criticised Dravid and Sharma for their selection of players at the auction, stating that his "biggest mistake was to abstain from the selection of the team."[16] Eventually, the chief cricketing officer of the franchise, Martin Crowe, resigned and Prasad was replaced by Ray Jennings as the head coach.[17]

At the 2009 player auction, the franchise signed Kevin Pietersen for a record US$1.55 million, making him the most expensive player alongside Andrew Flintoff (Chennai Super Kings).[18] They also traded Zaheer Khan for Robin Uthappa with the Mumbai Indians and brought in local batsman Manish Pandey.[19][20] Due to general elections in India, the tournament was held in South Africa.[21] Pietersen was named captain, but after a string of initial losses, Anil Kumble took over the captaincy when Pietersen left for national duty.[22] RCB's performance improved under Kumble, winning six of their last eight matches to finish third in the league table.[23] They defeated Chennai Super Kings in the semi-final but fell short by six runs in the final against Deccan Chargers.[24][25]

In 2010, the Royal Challengers, under Kumble's captaincy, secured seven wins from 14 matches, accumulating 14 points. Tied with three other teams for a playoff spot, their superior net run rate qualified them for the semi-finals.[26] In the semi-final, they were defeated by the table-toppers, the Mumbai Indians, by 35 runs.[27] However, the Royal Challengers secured a convincing nine-wicket win over the defending champions, the Deccan Chargers, in the third-place playoff, thus qualifying for the 2010 Champions League Twenty20.[28] Kumble retired at the conclusion of the Champions League, having led the team to the semi-finals of both the IPL and the CLT20 that year.[29]

On 8 January 2011, the IPL Governing Council held the auction for the fourth season of the league. Franchises had the option of retaining a maximum of four players for a sum of US$4.5 million.[30] However, RCB retained only Virat Kohli, leaving their other players to re-enter the auction pool. During the auction, Bangalore made significant acquisitions, including Tillakaratne Dilshan, Zaheer Khan, AB de Villiers, Daniel Vettori, Saurabh Tiwary, Dirk Nannes, and Cheteshwar Pujara.[31] Daniel Vettori was named captain for the season.[32] RCB began their campaign with a win over the newly formed Kochi Tuskers Kerala.[33] However, they faced three consecutive defeats against Mumbai Indians, Deccan Chargers, and Chennai Super Kings.[34][35][36] Dirk Nannes was replaced by Chris Gayle because of an injury.[37] Gayle's inclusion led RCB to a seven-match winning streak.[38][39] In their final league match, RCB defeated defending champions Chennai Super Kings, securing the top position in the points table.[40] They lost the final, again facing the Super Kings, by 58 runs. Chris Gayle was named Man of the Tournament.[41] Royal Challengers Bangalore reached the 2011 Champions League Twenty20 semi-finals after finishing runner-up in the IPL. They won their final group match against Southern Redbacks on the last ball and beat New South Wales Blues in the semis.[42][43] They lost the final to Mumbai Indians.[44]

Before the 2012 auction, RCB retained Chris Gayle and secured Andrew McDonald from Delhi Daredevils.[45][46] In the auction, RCB acquired Vinay Kumar and Muttiah Muralitharan.[47] RCB began the 2012 IPL season without Chris Gayle, who was recovering from an injury.[48] AB de Villiers and Muttiah Muralitharan contributed to a winning start against Delhi Daredevils.[49] RCB won eight out of their sixteen games but failed to qualify for the playoffs.[50][51] Gayle was the highest run-scorer of the tournament with 733 runs, including a century.[52]

Before the 2015 auction, RCB secured Manvinder Bisla from Kolkata Knight Riders and Iqbal Abdulla from Rajasthan Royals, as well as Mandeep Singh from Kings XI Punjab during the transfer window.[67] In the auction, they bought Daren Sammy, Sean Abbott, Subramaniam Badrinath, Sarfaraz Khan, and Dinesh Karthik, among others.[68] Royal Challengers started their season with a win against KKR at Eden Gardens in Kolkata.[69] During the group stage, they won a total of seven out of fourteen matches, finishing in third place on the points table.[70] In the playoffs, they defeated Rajasthan Royals in the Eliminator by 71 runs.[71] However, in the second qualifier against the Chennai Super Kings, RCB lost by 3 wickets, knocking them out of the tournament.[72] AB de Villiers, Virat Kohli, and Chris Gayle were the 4th, 5th, and 6th highest run-scorers of the season, respectively, while Yuzvendra Chahal was the team's highest wicket-taker and the 3rd highest overall in the season.[73][74]

Main articles: Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019

Virat Kohli was the leading run-scorer of the 2016 season with 973 runs, the highest ever in IPL history.
Amid financial scandals involving owner and chairman Vijay Mallya, Amrit Thomas became the chairman of the Royal Challengers.[75] In the 2016 season, RCB introduced different jerseys for home and away matches.[76] During the player auction, they acquired Shane Watson, Kane Richardson, Stuart Binny, Travis Head, and Samuel Badree, among others.[77] Additionally, KL Rahul and Parvez Rasool joined RCB from Sunrisers Hyderabad.[78] RCB won their first match of the season against Sunrisers, with AB de Villiers and Virat Kohli scoring 82 and 75 runs, respectively.[79] However, they struggled in the next six matches, securing only one win against Rising Pune Supergiant, which made it challenging to qualify for the playoffs. However, RCB qualified for the playoffs, losing only one match in their next seven games.[80] They set a record by defeating the Gujarat Lions with a winning margin of 144 runs, the highest in IPL history.[81][a] RCB finished the group stage in second place on the points table with 16 points.[83] In the playoffs, they faced Gujarat Lions in Qualifier 1 at their home ground, M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, and won by 4 wickets, advancing to their third final in nine seasons.[84] In the final against Sunrisers Hyderabad in Bangalore, RCB lost by 8 runs, ending the season as runners-up for the third time in IPL history.[85] Yuzvendra Chahal and Shane Watson were the second and third highest wicket-takers of the tournament, while Virat Kohli won the Orange Cap for scoring the most runs in the tournament, amassing 973 runs – the highest ever in IPL history.[86][87][88]

In the 2017 player auctions, the Royal Challengers acquired Tymal Mills, Aniket Choudhary, Pawan Negi, Praveen Dubey, and Billy Stanlake.[89] Mitchell Starc parted ways with the team to rehabilitate ahead of the Champions Trophy, prompting the management to replace him with Tymal Mills.[90][91] The season for RCB was impacted by injuries, with skipper Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers missing the initial matches. This led to Shane Watson stepping in as the interim captain. Batsmen KL Rahul and Sarfaraz Khan were also ruled out for the season due to prolonged injuries.[92] RCB finished at the bottom of the table, losing ten out of their fourteen matches.[93] In a match against the Kolkata Knight Riders, RCB was all out for just 49 runs, marking the lowest score ever in an IPL match.[94][95] Virat Kohli was the leading run-scorer for the team with 308 runs in the tournament, while Pawan Negi took the most wickets, claiming 16.[96][97]

Main articles: Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023
In August 2019, Simon Katich replaced Gary Kirsten as the head coach of the team, and Mike Hesson was appointed as the director of cricket operations.[111] Ahead of the 2020 IPL auction, RCB released several players, including Colin de Grandhomme, Dale Steyn, Heinrich Klaasen, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Akshdeep Nath, Marcus Stoinis, Shimron Hetmyer, and Tim Southee.[112] During the auction, RCB added Aaron Finch, Chris Morris, Joshua Philippe, Kane Richardson, Pavan Deshpande, Dale Steyn, Shahbaz Ahmed, and Isuru Udana to their squad.[113] They also released a new logo ahead of the season.[114] The 2020 IPL season was postponed and eventually held in the UAE due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[115] RCB qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 2016, finishing fourth on the points table with 14 points.[116] They faced Sunrisers Hyderabad in the Eliminator but lost by six wickets.[117] Devdutt Padikkal was the team's leading run-scorer with 473 runs, followed by Virat Kohli with 466 runs and AB de Villiers with 454 runs.[118] Yuzvendra Chahal was the highest wicket-taker, taking 21 wickets, followed by Chris Morris and Mohammad Siraj, who each took 11 wickets.[119]

During the 2021 IPL auction, RCB acquired Glenn Maxwell, Mohammed Azharuddeen, Sachin Baby, Kyle Jamieson, Srikar Bharat, Rajat Patidar, Dan Christian, and Suyash Prabhudessai.[120] The season was suspended midway due to a sudden rise in COVID-19 cases among players and resumed in September in the UAE.[121][122] Before the season's resumption, the team's head coach, Simon Katich, resigned, and Mike Hesson took over as head coach.[123] RCB qualified for the playoffs by finishing third in the points table but failed to lift the trophy once again, losing to fourth placed Kolkata Knight Riders in the Eliminator.[124][125] Harshal Patel finished the season with 32 wickets, equalling Dwayne Bravo's record for the highest number of wickets taken in a season and winning the Purple Cap.[126][127] Glenn Maxwell was the highest run-scorer for the team with 513 runs, the fifth highest in the season.[128] Virat Kohli became the first-ever batsman to score 6,000 runs in the IPL during this season.[129] This season marked AB de Villiers's last in the IPL, as he announced his retirement in November 2021.[130]

RCB’s bowlers played a crucial role in defending the total. Krunal Pandya took 2 wickets for 17 runs, and Bhuvneshwar Kumar claimed 2 for 38, helping RCB control the game in the final overs.[147]

This win ended an 18-year wait for the franchise, which had previously finished as runners-up in 2009, 2011, and 2016. The title was a major milestone for Virat Kohli, who had been with the team since its founding in 2008, and was widely celebrated by fans and cricket enthusiasts across the country.[148][149]

Team identity
Naming
Vijay Mallya wanted to associate one of his top-selling liquor brands, either McDowell's No.1 or Royal Challenge with the team.[150] The latter was chosen, hence the name.

Logo

The logo of Royal Challengers Bengaluru since 2023.
The logo initially consisted of the RC emblem in yellow on a circular red base with the black text "Royal Challengers Bangalore" in standard format surrounding the circular logo. The RC crown emblem with the roaring lion placed on the top of the logo was derived from the original Royal Challenge logo. No significant changes took place in the design of the logo except for the replacement of colour yellow with gold from 2009. This logo also had a dotted white circle around the RC emblem. The team also uses an alternate logo for the Game for Green matches where the green plants surround the logo and the text Game for Green is placed below the logo. The logo was redesigned in 2016 with the inclusion of black as a secondary colour. The lion emblem in the crest was enlarged and the shield was omitted in the new design. In 2020, a new logo was unveiled featuring a bigger lion and the crown returning from the previous logo. The RC emblem was omitted for this crest.[151] In 2024 Logo changed again in which RCB written on top and Royal Challengers Bangalore are renamed as Royal Challengers Bengaluru. The Royal Challengers Bengaluru appears at the bottom

Ambassadors
Katrina Kaif was the brand ambassador for the team in 2008. Deepika Padukone, Ramya, Puneeth Rajkumar, Shiva Rajkumar, Upendra and Ganesh have been the ambassadors for the team in the later seasons.[152]

Rivalries
Kolkata Knight Riders
Main article: Kolkata Knight Riders–Royal Challengers Bangalore rivalry
The rivalry between Kolkata Knight Riders and Royal Challengers Bangalore is one of the oldest in the IPL. The inaugural match of IPL was played between both the teams in which KKR won by 140 runs due to a 158* off just 73 balls by Brendon McCullum.[153]

In the IPL 2009, RCB won in both encounters against Knight Riders. During the second time they faced each other, Ross Taylor played a notable innings, scoring 81* runs off 33 balls, contributing significantly to RCB's victory by six wickets.[154]

In the 2012 edition of IPL, KKR was at the lower half of the IPL table and needed to win the crucial match against RCB. KKR won the toss and chose to bat first. Then KKR Skipper Gautam Gambhir led from the front with 93 (51). In reply, RCB lost wickets at regular intervals, as only Chris Gayle managed to put up a fight with a score of 86 (58).[155] The next time they met, Gambhir again was the thorn in RCB's side as he top scored for KKR at a tough pitch, taking KKR to a competitive total of 165. RCB in reply made 129, as Lakshmipathy Balaji ripped through their line-up with a 4/18 in 4 overs.[156]

In the 2015 IPL edition, RCB and KKR took part in a match reduced due to rain. It was reduced to a 10-over match. RCB won the toss and elected to field. For KKR, Andre Russell was the top scorer as he scored 45 off just 17 balls. He took them to a score of 111/4 in just 10 overs. Mitchell Starc took one wicket for 15 runs in 2 overs. In reply, RCB were at 0–48 at 3.4 overs before Brad Hogg got Chris Gayle out. After that, RCB stuttered and started to collapse as they were reduced to 3–81 in 7.2 overs. When Virat Kohli got out to Andre Russell, the match looked to be over for RCB. However, Mandeep Singh scored 45 off just 18 balls, hitting 3 sixes and 4 fours.[157]

In the 2017 IPL edition, Kolkata Knight Riders and Royal Challengers Bangalore again faced each other twice. In the first match between them, RCB got KKR out for a score of 131 after KKR had made a strong start of 0–48 in 3.3 overs. However, KKR dismissed RCB for 49, the lowest team score in the history of IPL. Nathan Coulter Nile, Colin de Grandhomme and Chris Woakes got three wickets each.[157] In the next match, Sunil Narine scored what was then the fastest fifty in IPL (50 off 15 balls – which is now the second-fastest). KKR made the highest score made in powerplay in any IPL match, and easily chased down the target offered by RCB.[157]

The 2019 IPL saw Virat Kohli scoring 84 off 49 and AB de Villiers scoring 63 off 32, taking RCB to a total of 205/3. KKR had a strong start, scoring 28/0 in 1.3 overs before losing wickets at regular intervals and having their run rate reduced. They were 139/4 in 15.5 overs. However, Dinesh Karthik and Andre Russell brought back the chase under control. Karthik got out after scoring 19 off 15, leaving KKR at 153/5 in 17 overs. Andre Russell, however, took KKR over the line as he scored 48 off 13, hitting Mohammed Siraj for 23 runs in one over.[157]

In the next match, RCB struck back as Virat Kohli made his 5th IPL century, scoring 100 runs in 58 balls only. Moeen Ali scored 66 runs in only 28 balls as RCB scored 213 runs. For KKR, Nitish Rana scored 85 off 46 and Andre Russell scored 65 off 25, taking the game down to the wire. However, RCB won the match by 10 runs, with Virat Kohli being Man of the Match.[158]

Chennai Super Kings
The epic rivalry with Chennai Super Kings is called Southern derby.[159][160] The Super Kings beat the Royal Challengers in the final of the 2011 IPL, the only meeting between the two teams at an IPL final.[161]

CSK had an upper hand over RCB in the subsequent seasons from 2012 to 2023, winning 14 out of the 20 encounters, including in 2015, where both teams faced off 3 times in the same season with CSK winning all 3 of them.[162]

The seasons 2024 and 2025 saw the tide turn in RCB's favour. In 2024, RCB knocked CSK out of the IPL by winning their last game of the season, which was also considered a virtual quarter final as the winner of the game would have made it to the qualifiers. RCB were required to win the game with good margin to not only equal CSK at 14 points on the points table but to also better them in terms of net run rate and qualify in the 4th spot. It came down to wire at the Chinnaswamy where RCB were required to defend 35 runs in the last over to win, but more importantly not give away more than 16 runs to ensure qualification. Yash Dayal's last over ensured RCB gave away just 7 runs to win 6th game on a trot that season, and qualify.[163]

In the 2025, for the first time, saw RCB win all of their games against CSK in a season while also win at Chepauk, CSK's home, after 17 years. The last game at Chinnaswamy, saw a repeat of the event of the previous season's game. Yash Dayal again defended 16 runs in the last over to ensure RCB's win.[164]

Deccan Chargers and Sunrisers Hyderabad
Another notable rivalry involving RCB is with the Hyderabad franchises, first with the now defunct Deccan Chargers and with the Sunrisers Hyderabad. The Deccan Chargers won six out of the 11 clashes between the two and the Sunrisers currently lead with 12 games to 11. There is also a notable trend where the Hyderabad franchise has jeopardised RCB's campaigns in some way or the other. In the 2009 and 2016 seasons, they were beaten in the finals by Chargers and Sunrisers respectively. In the 2020 season, Sunrisers knocked RCB out of the tournament in the eliminator. In the 2021 season, Sunrisers, who did not qualify for the playoffs, were able to beat RCB, causing them to finish in 3rd place and forcing them to play the eliminator, which they lost to KKR.[165] Their 2022 IPL campaign was also affected by SRH, whom they lost to by 9 wickets after scoring 68 in their first encounter, putting them under pressure because of their negative run rate through their otherwise strong campaign.[166]

In the latest chapter of the rivalry between the two in IPL 2024, like the Kolkata Knight Riders, Sunrisers Hyderabad were the first to break the 263-run record set by RCB, which seemed insurmountable at the time as a result of Chris Gayle's 175. In a more humiliating turn, SRH again broke RCB's record against RCB themselves on their home ground, scoring 287 runs, thanks to a 39-ball century by Travis Head and a 30-ball 67 by Heinrich Klassen. Although there was a valiant effort by RCB, spearheaded by Dinesh Karthik's 83 off 35 and captain Faf du Plessis's 62 off 28, RCB still lost by 25 runs.[167] SRH would break RCB's 263 record for the third time and score 266 against the Delhi Capitals after setting an all-time T20 record by scoring 125 runs inside the power-play.
