Exercises

1. Floating-Point Precision: Write a function that takes two floating-point numbers as input and checks if they are approximately equal within a given tolerance (e.g., 1e-6).

2. String Manipulation: Write a function that takes a string as input and returns a dictionary containing the frequency of each word in the string. Use regular expressions to remove punctuation and convert the string to lowercase.

3. List Comprehension and Filtering: Given a list of numbers, use list comprehension to create a new list containing only the numbers that are divisible by both 2 and 3.
4. Dictionary and Set Operations: You have two lists of user IDs: active_users and inactive_users. Convert them to sets and find the users who are in both lists (i.e., users who were once active but are now inactive).â‰ˆ

solution: using abs here coz, we don't need signs ()-ve or +ve which can impact the results, since we are checking for the tolerance only. i.e the difference is less that 1e-6 or not, so if the overall dif is in neg, it blindly says out of tolerance which negates the purpose.
here we can use Decimal object, i.e Decimal('num'), this will be more accurate, but in production we will not use this mostly becuase it comes with cost. unlike float it is software dependant which makes it more slower
